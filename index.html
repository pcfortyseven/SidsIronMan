        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Embarking on the challenging journey of an IRONMAN is no small feat. <br/> It requires determination, resilience, and a support system that stands strong through every trial.<br/> As Napoleon Hill once said, "Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve." This quote perfectly encapsulates the essence of my IRONMAN story.</p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>The Race Day Challenge:
On the fateful 8th of October 2023, I stood on the start line, knowing that I had a 1.9km open water swim, a 90km cycling leg, and a 21.1km run ahead of me. Little did I know that the path to the finish line would be filled with unexpected challenges—a misguided longer sea swim loop, a flat tire on the bike, chain slipping, cramps in the legs, extreme heat, and humidity. Yet, with unwavering determination, I conquered each obstacle, completing the race in 8 hours and 7 minutes.
<br/><br/>
<b>Balancing Passion and Reality:</b>
Managing the demands of a triathlon alongside a professional and personal life is no easy feat. The sport demands dedicated time that becomes harder to find as responsibilities grow. However, my journey was fueled by passion, supported by family and friends, and marked by the absence of some conventional training elements. No personal coach, professional guidance, or top-notch equipment—just a zeal to succeed.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Essential Ingredients:</b>
Becoming an IRONMAN requires more than physical training; it demands emotional and mental strength. A sea swim practice, a well-thought-out nutrition plan, and the constant support of family and friends play a crucial role. In my journey, the belief and blessings of my parents, the companionship of friends, and the dedicated support of individuals like Prathmesh, Dnyaneshwar, and others were indispensable.
<br/><br/>
<b>Acknowledging the Pillars of Support:</b>
Special mentions go to those who stood by me throughout this incredible journey. <br/> @pc_fortyseven, My cycling buddy, was a constant force, providing assistance whenever I faced challenges. <br/> @dnyaneshwar.honde stepped in during the final moments, highlighting the importance of having a supportive presence.<br/> @hardik_rath0d, my running partner, fueled those early morning runs, <br/> @gshreya_27 offered moral support, reminding me of the importance of consistency.<br/> @akshay_bordekar's motivational quotes and calls provided the extra push needed to stay on course.
